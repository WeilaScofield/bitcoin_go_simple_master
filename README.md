# Something about Network
At the beginning, I used different sockets to identify couples of nodes. It's very easy to implement virtual distributed network. But It's not real enough as actual world. I considered docker is a good way to find solution. Besides, this distributed network is not the real decentralized network literally, cause there is centreal node in hard code. I gotta make more efforts to make whole thing better.
